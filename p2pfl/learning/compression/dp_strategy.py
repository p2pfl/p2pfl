Post-Training Differential Privacy strategy for Local DP.

This implements POST-TRAINING differential privacy, where noise is added once
to the final model update, NOT during training (unlike traditional DP-SGD).

DESIGN RATIONALE FOR POST-TRAINING LOCAL DP IN P2PFL:

In a decentralized federated learning environment like p2pfl, we made the
critical design decision to implement Local Differential Privacy (LDP) as a
"compression" technique rather than a training modification. Here's why:

1. NO TRUSTED AGGREGATOR:
   - In p2pfl, any node can act as an aggregator
   - There's no central trusted server - aggregators are just peers
   - We must assume aggregators could be curious or malicious
   - Therefore, privacy protection MUST happen before data leaves the client

2. WHY COMPRESSION FRAMEWORK?
   - p2pfl converts all models to numpy arrays before transmission
   - This conversion point is the perfect place to add privacy
   - Compression pipeline is already framework-agnostic (works with PyTorch, TF, etc.)
   - No need to modify training code or add framework-specific callbacks

3. LOCAL DP APPROACH:
   - Each client adds noise to their own updates (local privacy)
   - Privacy guarantee holds even if aggregator is malicious
   - No need for secure aggregation or trusted execution environments
   - Simple, clean integration with existing p2pfl architecture

4. IMPLEMENTATION AS "LOSSY COMPRESSION":
   - DP is essentially controlled information loss for privacy
   - Clipping = bounding the information content
   - Noise = lossy transformation that cannot be reversed
   - Fits naturally in the compression pipeline alongside quantization, sparsification

This design ensures that privacy protection is:
- Automatic: Applied during model encoding, no extra steps needed
- Framework-agnostic: Works with any ML framework
- Composable: Can combine with other compressions (quantization, TopK, etc.)
- Untrusted-aggregator-safe: Privacy guaranteed even against malicious aggregators

    Apply POST-TRAINING local differential privacy as a compression technique.

    This implements POST-TRAINING DP, where privacy is applied once to the final
    model update after training completes, NOT during training iterations.

    Key differences from traditional DP-SGD:
    - Traditional DP-SGD: Clips/adds noise to gradients at EACH training step
    - Post-Training DP: Clips/adds noise ONCE to the final model update

    This approach:
    1. Requires NO modifications to local training code
    2. Works with any ML framework
    3. Typically has less accuracy loss (noise added once vs. many times)

    The compressor acts as a state machine:
    - If previous_params is None: treats input as model update directly
    - If previous_params is provided: computes update = params - previous_params
