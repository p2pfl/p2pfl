## üñã Code quality expectations

To maintain a high level of code quality, we require all contributions to adhere to the following standards:

* **Formatting:** Use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting. Run `poetry run ruff format p2pfl` before submitting a pull request.  Also, check for any remaining issues with `poetry run ruff check p2pfl`.

* **Type Hinting:**  Use type hints and ensure your code passes [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) type checking. Run `poetry run mypy -p p2pfl` before submitting.

* **Testing:** Provide comprehensive tests for all new code using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and ensure test coverage with [Pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Run `poetry run pytest -v --cov=p2pfl` before submitting.

* **Documentation:**  Document your code using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).  Pay particular attention to documenting the module you are contributing to.  Refer to the [main components documentation](https://p2pfl.github.io/p2pfl/components.html) for examples and guidance.

* **Design Principles:** Adhere to SOLID principles, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It).

* **Design Patterns:** Utilize appropriate design patterns for modularity and flexibility.  We commonly use:
    * **Template Pattern:** For consistent interfaces (e.g., `CommunicationProtocol`, `Learner`).
    * **Command Pattern:** For defining executable commands over the `CommunicationProtocol`.
    * **Strategy Pattern:** For interchangeable algorithms and workflows (e.g., `Aggregator`, `Workflow`).
    * For more detailed information on the design patterns used, please refer to the [main components documentation](https://p2pfl.github.io/p2pfl/components.html), with emphasis on the module you are going to contribute to.

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all of the following commands run successfully:

```bash
poetry run ruff format p2pfl
poetry run ruff check p2pfl
poetry run mypy -p p2pfl
poetry run pytest -v --cov=p2pfl
```
