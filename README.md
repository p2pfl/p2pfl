P2PFL is a general-purpose open-source library designed for the execution (simulated and in real environments) of Decentralized Federated Learning systems, specifically making use of P2P networks and the gossip protocols.

## ✨ Key Features

P2PFL offers a range of features designed to make decentralized federated learning accessible and efficient. For detailed information, please refer to our [documentation](https://p2pfl.github.io/p2pfl/).

| Feature          | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🚀 Easy to Use   | [Get started](https://p2pfl.github.io/p2pfl/quickstart.html) quickly with our intuitive API.       |
| 🛡️ Reliable     | Built for fault tolerance and resilience.       |
| 🌐 Scalable      | Leverages the power of peer-to-peer networks.    |
| 🧪 Versatile     | Experiment in simulated or real-world environments.|
| 🔒 Private       | Prioritizes data privacy with decentralized architecture.|
| 🧩 Flexible      | Designed to be easy to modify.|
| 📈 Real-time Monitoring | Manage and track experiment through [P2PFL Web Services platform](https://p2pfl.com). |
| 🧠 ML Frameworks | Seamlessly integrate [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) models. |
| 📡 Communication Protocol Agnostic | Choose the communication protocol that best suits your needs (e.g., [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)). |
| 🔌 Integrations  | Enhanced capabilities through integrations: [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), ML frameworks, communication protocols, and [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) for large-scale simulations. |
