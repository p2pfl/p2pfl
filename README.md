## 🔌 Integrations

> todo

- Hugging Face Datasets
- PyTorch
- Tensorflow

## 📥 Installation

> **Note:** We recommend using Python 3.9 or lower. We have found some compatibility issues with Python 3.10 and PyTorch.

### 👨🏼‍💻 For Users

```bash
pip install "p2pfl[torch]"
```

### 👨🏼‍🔧 For Developers

#### 🐍 Python (using Poetry)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pguijas/p2pfl.git
cd p2pfl
poetry install -E torch 
```

> **Note:** Use the extras (`-E`) flag to install specific dependencies (e.g., `-E torch`). Use `--no-dev` to exclude development dependencies.

#### 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker build -t p2pfl .
docker run -it --rm p2pfl bash
```
